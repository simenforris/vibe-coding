This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project using Bun, Tailwind CSS v4, and the latest best practices for theming and font loading.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies (if needed):

```sh
bun install
```

To start the development server:

```sh
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

You can edit the main page in [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx). The app supports hot reloading.

## Formatting & Linting

To format the codebase with Prettier:

```sh
bun format
```

To lint the codebase with ESLint:

```sh
bun lint
```

## Features

- Next.js 15 with the App Router
- Bun as the package manager and runtime
- Tailwind CSS v4 with `@theme`-based custom theming
- Prettier and ESLint for formatting and linting
- DM Sans and DM Mono loaded and configured via `next/font`
